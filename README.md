##Virtual Assistant 

#Project Overview:

 The Virtual Assistant Project is a  Python-based application designed to provide users with voice-activated support for tasks like retrieving information, opening websites, providing weather updates, and answering questions using Wikipedia. 
The project integrates advanced libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and a graphical user interface built with CustomTkinter.

#Features:

  Voice Command Recognition: Recognizes and processes user voice commands for various tasks.
  Dynamic Website Access: Opens websites with common domain extensions dynamically.
  Weather Updates: Provides real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  
#Wikipedia Search: 

  Fetches concise answers to user queries from Wikipedia.
  
#GUI Integration: 

  Displays assistant responses and user input in an intuitive graphical interface.
  Theme Customization: Offers light, dark, and system themes for the interface.
  
#Workflow:
  1)Input:
    The user provides a voice command through a      microphone.
  2)Processing:
    The command is processed using speech_recognition.
    Tasks are identified using keyword matching.  
  3)Execution:
    Websites are opened.
    Weather updates are fetched.
    Queries are resolved via Wikipedia.
      
#Output: 
  Responses are displayed in the GUI and spoken aloud.
  
#Enhancements:
 *Added support for multiple domain extensions in dynamic website access.
 *Enhanced error handling for invalid or ambiguous commands.
 *Integrated Wikipedia disambiguation  resolution.
 *Implemented API-based real-time weather updates.
 *Added GUI theme-switching functionality for better user experience.

#Technologies Used:
            *Languages:
              Python
              
            *Libraries:
              pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion
              speech_recognition for voice command processing
              CustomTkinter for GUI development
              wikipedia for querying information
              requests for API communication
              
            *APIs:
              OpenWeatherMap for weather data
  
#How to Run:
  Install the required libraries using pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition customtkinter wikipedia requests.
  Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key and replace the placeholder in the code.
  Run the Python script: python assistant.py.
  Interact with the assistant via the GUI and microphone.
  Challenges Identified
  Accurately recognizing speech with noisy input.
  Handling ambiguous or incomplete commands.
  Dynamically resolving website domain extensions.
  
Future Scope:
    Integrating natural language processing (NLP) for advanced command understanding.
    Adding multi-language support.
    Including calendar and email management features.
    Developing a mobile-friendly version.
